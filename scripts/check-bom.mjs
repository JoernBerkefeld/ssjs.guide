/**
 * Strips UTF-8 byte-order marks from staged text files and re-stages the fixes.
 *
 * A BOM in front of a Jekyll page's opening `---` is invisible in most editors but
 * stops the frontmatter block from being recognised, so the page silently loses its
 * layout/permalink. Stripping a BOM is lossless and never undesirable in this repo,
 * so the fix is applied automatically instead of blocking the commit.
 *
 * Only the staged file list is inspected (fast, and never touches unstaged work), and
 * only extensions on the text allow-list below — a byte-prefix strip on a binary such
 * as a JPEG would corrupt it.
 *
 * Line endings are deliberately left alone: the committed blob is what matters, and
 * rewriting working-tree files here would add churn without changing it.
 *
 * Run from the ssjs.guide repo root:
 *   node scripts/check-bom.mjs
